# Custom ergodox ez keymap

This is my custom ergodox ez keympap.

It is adapted from an ANSI QWERTY keyboard.
It is made so I can use it very easily to write French and not only English.
Indeed in the third layer (which is easily accessible with one thumb) are all the 
French special characters that I am susceptible to use, and even more.

The raw_keymap.pdf file is the layout that I built using the online configurator 
from [the ergodox ez website.](https://ergodox-ez.com/)
This raw layout does not contain any of the French characters, I've added those ones
by using macros.
Since I use windows at my work and linux at home there is also a key that makes the 
keyboard toggle from windows to linux mode and inversely, in that way I adapted all the 
macros to work on both OS (ctrl+shift+u+code for linux and alt+code for windows).
